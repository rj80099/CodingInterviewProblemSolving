# CodingInterviewProblemSolving
This repository is to track my progress in DSA and it going to be in depth problem solving question in DSA from various platforms and resources.
The preffered language is going to be C++ but i may switch to JAVA or might create a seperate branch for JAVA language.
<p> Entire repo is going to contain folders for different programming patterns </p>
As we go along below patterns will be updated.

## Basic logic patterns

## Prefix sum patterns

## Two pointer patterns

## Sliding windows patterns

## Fast and Slow Pointer patterns

## Linked in-place reversal patterns

## Monotonic stack patterns

## Top 'k' Elements patterns

## Overlap intervals patterns

## Modified binary search patterns

## Binary tree reversal patterns

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## Matrix traversal patterns

## Backtracking patterns

## Dynamic programming patterns
